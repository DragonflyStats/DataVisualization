Start Plotting Online
When plotting online, the plot and data will be saved to your cloud account. There are two methods for plotting online: py.plot() and py.iplot(). Both options create a unique url for the plot and save it in your Plotly account.
Use py.plot() to return the unique url and optionally open the url.
Use py.iplot() when working in a Jupyter Notebook to display the plot in the notebook.
Copy and paste one of the following examples to create your first hosted Plotly graph using the Plotly Python library:

trace1 = Scatter(
    x=[1, 2, 3, 4],

data = Data([trace0, trace1])

High five! You successfuly sent some data to your account on plotly.
